      enabled: yes
      filetype: regular

   sudo suricata-update 
After configuring Suricata, you can start it in IDS mode 
   sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth0
Replace eth0 with your network interface. Suricata will start monitoring traffic and generate alerts based on your rules.
Suricata will log alerts to /var/log/suricata/eve.json
